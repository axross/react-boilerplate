// you can use this file to add your custom webpack plugins, loaders and anything you like.
// This is just the basic way to add additional webpack configurations.
// For more information refer the docs: https://storybook.js.org/configurations/custom-webpack-config

// IMPORTANT
// When you add this file, we won't add the default configurations which is similar
// to "React Create App". This only has babel loader to load JavaScript.

const rootConfig = require("../webpack.config");

  // `mode` has a value of 'DEVELOPMENT' or 'PRODUCTION'
  // You can change the configuration based on that.
  // 'PRODUCTION' is used when building the static version of storybook.
